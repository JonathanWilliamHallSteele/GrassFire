Welcome!

To run this grassfire algorithm, begin by compiling and running “GrassFire.java” using the following commands:

"javac GrassFire.java"
"java GrassFire.java"

Once running, you will be prompted for 4 separate inputs to generate a map, including

Map Size, the percentage of wall generation, the location on the first row that you want the starting node to be, and the location of the finish node.

After all your inputs have been entered, the algorithm will generate a map, and then output the shortest possible path
